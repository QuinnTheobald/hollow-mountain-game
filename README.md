# hollow-mountain-game
A taoist text-based adventure in the style of Colossal Caves. Built by Claude.

Prompt: "Can you write a text-based adventure like Colossal Caves that espouses the values of taoism?"

Analysis:<br/>
The game Claude creates is clearly playable and has a gorgeous aesthetic. Looking through the code, it's quite well organized and easy to follow. So where does it fail? Well, for starters the Taoist theme is fun but rather shallow. Ideally the vision for a game like this would be that playing the game teaches some sort of lesson, which of course is too big a task to expect from the LLM. Secondly, old text-based adventures lean heavily into puzzle solving. You get the key from this room to open the door in that room. Hollow Mountain has none of this, but perhaps that is intentional so make the game feel more exploratory and less goal-oriented. Whatever the failings, the game would be really easy to extend from here and add new features and options. Years ago in high school I built a text-based adventure and it took me maybe 40 hours. With Claude I could accomplish the same game in a handful of hours and the end result would probably be cleaner and more aesthetic.
